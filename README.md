About The System

Talking about the system, it lacks one basic thing that is the login panel for the administrator. You can simply add the login panel to make it more secure and private. The system is all from the admin side. Admin has the full access to the system. The user can only book and reserve hotel rooms. The user can either book room which is paid, or can reserve the room for later confirmation or simply can book rooms. After that, then the user can make payments and the admin and the application generates the payment invoice.

Not only this the admin can easily add rooms and its services types. The admin can create many other facilities required for the guests in a hotel. Also, the user can book other miscellaneous activities in the hotel booking system. As a whole, this system is very much effective and user-friendly.
